# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

How to Play:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.
5. The game announces the winner or declares a draw at the end.

Features:

- Two players can play against each other on the same terminal.
- The program checks for valid inputs and prevents moves in occupied spaces.
- It announces the winner or declares a draw based on the game outcome.

Controls:

- Players take turns by entering a number corresponding to an empty space on the grid.
- The grid is numbered from 1 to 9.

Dependencies:

- The program is written in C and uses standard C libraries (stdio.h) for input and output.
